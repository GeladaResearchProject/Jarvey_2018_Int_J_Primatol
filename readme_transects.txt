ReadMe file for transects

This file contains the data set of point-intercept transects analyzed in "Graminivory and fallback foods: Annual diet profile of geladas (Theropithcus gelada) living in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia", by Jarvey, J.C., Low, B.S., Pappano, D.J., Bergman, T.J., & Beehner, J.C. in the International Journal of Primatology. 
The data were collected by Jarvey, Julie C., Pappano, David J., and Hawley, Caitlin R. in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethoipia from Feb/10/2015-Jan/24/2016.
Please contact Julie Jarvey with any questions.

Data were collected once per month from 30 transects using the point-intercept method to estimate monthly aboveground food availabiltiy for gelada monkeys. 
Mean monthly % green graminoid leaves was considered aboveground food availability for this ananlysis, and calculated using graminoid leaf hits:

     % green graminoid leaves/transect = (total # of green graminoid leaf hits/ total # of all graminoid leaf hits) x 100

     mean monthly % green graminoid leaves was calculated by averaging % green graminoid leaves/transect of the 30 transects each month.

 
Each row represents a point along a transect during a sampling month. Each transect contains 25 points, spaced 1 meter apart. 
Please see Methods section in the paper for details on how transect data were collected.
