This file contains the data set of foraging scans from adult gelada monkeys analyzed in "Graminivory and fallback foods: Annual diet profile of geladas (Theropithcus gelada) living in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia", by Jarvey, J.C., Low, B.S., Pappano, D.J., Bergman, T.J., & Beehner, J.C. in the International Journal of Primatology. 
The data were collected by Jarvey, Julie C., Pappano, David J., and Hawley, Caitlin R. in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia from Feb/2/2015-Jan/30/2016.

Data were collected using instantaneous scan samples at 10-minute intervals during, and summarized by diet category to calculate monthly and annual diet profiles. Annual diet was calculated by averaging over the 12-month study period. 
Each row represents a foraging scan of an adult gelada.
Please see Methods section in the paper for details on how scans were collected.
